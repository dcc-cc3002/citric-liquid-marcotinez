/** Each player has a personal "HomePanel," which is determined at the beginning
  * of the game and can be activated in two different ways:
  *
  * 1. If the player owns the panel, they can choose to stop on it when passing over it,
  *    even if they have remaining moves.
  *
  * 2. If the player does not own the panel, it will activate only if they land directly on it.
  *
  * In both cases, the turn ends after activating the panel. Upon activation, the player
  * regains one health point, and the panel will perform a Norma check.
  *
  * @param nextPanels An array of panels that are directly connected to this one.
